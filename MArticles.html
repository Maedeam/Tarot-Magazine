                                <p> Among an assortment of things I purchased in<span class="key pl" about="Japan"> Japan </span>,is a card that shows a woman running down the street with a cute white puppy hanging onto her leg (<em>Figure 1</em>). She jogs
                                    along a magenta ground, a blue sky with a purple butterfly and bright sun suspended above. She is wearing pink panties, and a yellow top has slipped beneath her exposed breasts. The words “The Fool” are written in English
                                    below the scene. Without context, it might be hard to recognize this as a card from a<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span> divination deck. It was created by writer Akatsuki Reika and artist Takano Aya (2010).
                                    Takano garnered fame as the protégé of the artist Murakami Takashi and his Superflat movement. Their deck, named Spiritual<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span>, features nude or barely clothed women moving
                                    through magical tableaus filled with arcane signs and richly colored settings. These whimsical divination cards join hundreds of other<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span> that have been created in Japan, most
                                    of them within the last two decades. One collector lists more than 1,500 Japan-made decks in his global compendium.<sup><a href="#Footnote2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> Japanese

                                <p>As a way to think about this increasingly popular practice, this essay will look at images from a few of the numerous<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span> decks designed in Japan. Additional selected cards from
                                    the decks discussed here are found in Appendix 1: Supplementary Figures of Japanese<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span> Cards. I find that these<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span> reflect a deliberate
                                    adaptation or creolization process across both cultural and temporal borders, with<span class="key" about="visual"> visual </span>"components customized for a Japanese viewer. My aim is to consider the nature of these
                                    changes in <span class="key" about="imagery">imagery</span> and to focus attention on an under-analyzed and mostly female-gendered domain. In particular, the medieval Europeans originally found on the cards are often
                                    purged or altered, replaced or mixed with images from the world of Japanese art, history, and popular culture.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>This survey of <span class="key" about="Tarot"><span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span> </span> in<span class="key pl" about="Japan"> Japan </span>,is based on anthropological ideas about cultural borrowing and innovation.
                                    One way to approach the cards is to think about them as beyond cultural appropriation, a term that is fraught with political debate. In its most common anthropological sense, appropriation simply means the adoption
                                    or use of elements from an outside or different cultural tradition into another culture. Currently, the construction “cultural appropriation” is best known to mean the taking of cultural property, rituals, or elements
                                    within a context of colonization or unequal power. It refers to inappropriate acts of appropriation from a dominant group in which the borrowed elements are used for consumption or feishization. An example is the use
                                    of sacred Native American ritual and clothing in mainstream U.S. sports entertainment or as a Halloween costume.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>In contrast to this negative form of cultural appropriation, some cultural p ractices are the product of creative borrowing that produces a new and unique amalgam of disparate elements. This mixing, called syncretism, creolization,
                                    or cultural hybridity, suggests more than simple borrowing, as it denotes the creation of new cultural forms. It is in this context that I place this survey of<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span> in Japan.
                                    I believe that these new
                                    <span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span> reflect a complex type of cultural hybridity that often confounds easy separation between Japanese and European or American elements. In a similar vein, the historian
                                    <span class="pers" about="Gruzinski">Gruzinski</span> (2002, 85) describes the clever appropriations from Europe that together with indigenous Mexican elements formed a “strange, fascinating, inextricable weave.” He
                                    notes that such intermingling takes place in layers of time that “combine as much as they contrast” (Gruzinski 2002, 10). Similarly in the case of<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span>, it is difficult to determine
                                    when or where certain elements in the <span class="key" about="imagery">imagery</span> originated. I try my best to track these bits of<span class="key" about="visual"> visual </span>"culture, but nevertheless invite
                                    others to refine my analysis, to see new themes and elements that make these cards even more complex and intriguing. In addition, what we see in<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span> is not always the product
                                    of a simple, one-time, Japan-West encounter. There are “multiple intermediate states and never just two cultures meeting across a clean border” (Gruzinski 2002, 178). The blending of
                                    <span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span> elements in
                                    <span class="key pl" about="Japan"> Japan </span>,takes place over decades and with different creators and target audiences involved.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>Finally, there is the problem of cultural authenticity. Although we can sometimes discern elements as being markedly from either Japanese or EuroAmerican<span class="key" about="visual"> visual </span>"culture, these are
                                    always generalizations that are open to criticism and challenge. For one thing, finding “authentic” culture in the current global domain is no easy matter. This discontinuity of culture in the modern world was beautifully
                                    stated by the anthropologist James Clifford (1988, 14): “Twentieth-century identities no longer presuppose continuous cultures or traditions. Everywhere individuals and groups improvise local performances from (re)collected
                                    pasts, drawing on foreign media, symbols, and languages.” An example discussed below is the use of the historical personage Himiko as the Figure of the High Priestess in Japanese
                                    <span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span> decks. Himiko did not arrive on the cards straight from history. Because so little is known about her, especially her appearance, the depictions are pure conjecture and
                                    imagination. In some cases she is holding a written text or book, which is historically inaccurate as there was no writing system in<span class="key pl" about="Japan"> Japan </span>,during Himiko’s time (170~248 CE).
                                    Yet use of Himiko on<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span> cards is not simply a decorative move, and she functions well in this context as a symbol of current Japanese concerns and interests.
                                </p>
                                <br>
                                <p>In addition to their great beauty, creativity, and expressive energy, these new<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span> decks function as<span class="key" about="visual"> visual </span>"mediations as they lure the
                                    divination seeker into a strange land where bodies rise from coffins, men wear snakes as belts, and English knights ride black horses and carry pentagrams. The hybrid or original cards from<span class="key pl" about="Japan"> Japan </span>,contain
                                    new elements or rhetorical<span class="key" about="visual"> visual </span>"devices that help to close the gap between cultures. Often the new<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span> of<span class="key pl" about="Japan"> Japan </span>,illustrate
                                    cultural displacement. For example, the card known as the High Priestess usually shows a female pope sitting on a throne, holding a copy of the Jewish Torah. But on some Japanese cards the High Priestess holds a different
                                    type of text: scrolls with non-Latin script or books with odd, invented glyphs on them. Understanding the semiotics of<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span>, as well as their role in arts practice, spiritual
                                    work, and creative pastime, gives us a new sense of the cultural landscape of Japan today, where anxieties over the economy, the nation’s global status, and even the geological safety of the land itself inspire people
                                    to search for hope.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>Attention to<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span> cards is important because of their great economic and cultural status. The<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span> industry is enormously lucrative, and
                                    <span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span> cards and<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span> services generate billions of yen each year in profit. Even so, many aspects of<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span>                                    culture pass under the mainstream radar and avoid male-controlled routes of distribution. I am interested in looking at<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span> not simply because it is a substantial market, but
                                    also because it provides recognition of female interests and activities. Despite its presence in a spectrum of media and contexts, it is rarely studied, and is usually trivialized when it is noticed at all. The Japanese
                                    media, academic, and business establishments most often report on the feminized divination industry with alarm, mockery, or disdain.</p>

                                    iconic principles (such as Temperance, Justice, Death, and so on), or archetypes (such as the Fool, the Magician, the High Priestess, the Hermit, and others). One of the most popular decks used as a jumping-off point

                                    <span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span> so appealing to women and girls. Although the underlying allegorical m eanings might remain, the images are often quite novel and stunning. As the primary producers and

                                <p>Many of the new<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span> decks encode aesthetic preferences that are circulating in female culture. The concept of cuteness, or <i>kawaii</i>, is globally understood as a defining trait
                                    of Japanese mass culture. Cute Japanese mascots, fashions, and everyday consumer goods are now broadly consumed and adored around the world. Cute<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span> cards are common and widely
                                    loved. An example of this most recognizable flavor of straight-up cuteness is a deck produced by the prolific card designer named Kagami Ryūji (2007) in which he used the early <span class="date" about="1975"> 1975 </span>                                    Sanrio characters Little Twin Stars (

                                    cleansed of negative <span class="key" about="imagery">imagery</span>. The Devil card, for example, presents the two in a<span class="key" about="visual"> visual </span>"story that denotes someone with devilish intent:
                                    Rara mischievously tries to surprise Kiki by giving him a concealed cat in a box. Instead of the towering horned satyr, a lecherous goat-man typically found on the traditional Western
                                    <span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span>, this version lurches toward cute overload. Beloved characters from childhood strategically replace odd foreign supernatural beings. The card’s original meaning of addiction
                                    to carnal pleasures and bondage to materialism has been transformed into the idea of devilish prankery and an intention to tease or shock. This type of displacement is common in new decks in

                                    the Devil is tempting her (Kagami <span class="date" about="2009"> 2009 </span>, <b>Figure 8</b>). When one’s heart is consumed with objects of desire, this is temptation. Anyone might identify with Kitty’s encounter

                                <p>While Japanese cute has taken on a flat, mostly saccharine meaning around the globe, we find that in Japanese girl culture there’s been an evolution and diversification in types of cuteness. One kind of cute is
                                    <i>guro kawaii</i> (grotesque cute), which combines elements of both the adorable and the warped, unnatural, or creepy. In the last fifteen years, the grotesque cute aesthetic, together with the fantastical and mystical,
                                    has become one of the favored styles in the world of<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span>. A perfect example of this is the Loveable Girl Skeleton deck created by Hoshi Saori and Satō Yūichirō (<span class="date"
                                        about="2013"> 2013 </span>). Their deck features two characters: a skeleton prince and a skeleton maid. The maid concept is based on the costume of the cafe worker in the maid cafe industry, where young women (primarily)
                                    dress up in frilly French maid outfits and serve coffee and bad, microwaved food. On one card, the skeleton maid takes the role of the Magician (usually a male Figure in EuroAmerican decks, <b>Figure 9</b>). The table
                                    before the skeleton maid magician is laden with objects representing the four suits, and her pose, as well as the infinity symbol floating above her head, are all similar to those found on the most popular decks outside
                                    of Japan. The cute grotesque maid skeleton is a familiar shape in a cryptic scene, making it <i>guro kawaii</i>, familiar and, indeed, loveable. While the esoteric symbolism nods to European

                                    strategy has the positive effect of presenting figures that are not gendered or racially marked, thus turning them into characters that anyone might identify with. For example, the Bi Anjeri<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span>                                    features sweet animal drawings (Bi and Umezawa 2004). Bi wrote that she wanted to design a deck that was easy to understand and that would also help to alleviate worry by giving the user pleasant images with uplifting
                                    signs. The card Temperance, for example, denotes moderation, balance, and harmony. For this card, most European decks depict a female or transgender person mixing liquid by pouring it from one vessel to another. In
                                    some decks the Figure signifies balance by having one foot on land and the other in a body of water. The Bi Anjeri<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span> features instead a small black and white dog with adorably
                                    big black eyes. The playful pooch wears a green dress and sports perky red bows on each ear (<b>Figure 10</b>). She is watering a strawberry plant and a fish bowl from two water cans held in two of her paws. The European
                                    notion of mixing wine with water as an effort towards moderation is lost, but no matter. Recasting the Figure as a dog in perfect balance achieves the same allegorical goal and is pleasant to behold.

                                    about a cat named Dayan and his compatriots who live in the fantasy village of Wachifield. In the Empress card, meant to symbolize a plentiful harvest and female power, the Mother Bunny is surrounded by five child bunnies.
                                    In place of a luxuriously gowned noblewoman seated in her lush garden holding a scepter, this new symbol of rabbit fecundity is wearing an ochre cloak, and has a green wreath on her head. She is holding a sheath of

                                <p>The deployment of adorable animals as substitutes for humans should not be interpreted as simply catering to a cultural craving for the aesthetics of cuteness. In fact, it is a strategy employed in multiple areas of popular
                                    culture that serves to allow wider identification with the figures, and is also reflected in such things as public service posters, etiquette books, and regional mascots (Miller 2010). In the case of
                                    <span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span>, replacement of medieval European queens, squires, popes, and hermits allows a non-white audience to more easily identify with the images. The animals strip the figures
                                    of ethnicity, nationality, and, in some cases, gender. In addition to Hello Kitty and Dayan,<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span> featuring pandas, bat princesses, beckoning cats, penguins, r abbits, white

                                    world. They welcome Japanese people into the fold, where they join a sisterhood of

                                    and religion. These new interpretive frames might retain the core archetypes of the cards or the symbolic meanings associated with them, but recast the figures as ones familiar to a Japanese audience. The producers
                                    and artists who 20 make these new cards study<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span> lore and history and are therefore k nowledgeable about the traditional Christian-infused <span class="key" about="imagery">imagery</span>                                    and symbolism. Yet they also know that the esoteric references will not necessarily be meaningful or particularly attractive or interesting in a Japanese context, so inserting native archetypes and symbols into the
                                    <span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span> milieu proves to be a savvy and successful approach. It is also somewhat ironic that a borrowed Western form of divination now serves as a vehicle for a revived interest

                                    uses well-known characters and images from Japanese folktales to illustrate his deck. The card for Strength, for example, features Kintarō, a famous plump boy with superhuman strength. For the card representing the
                                    Hierophant (also known as The Pope or The High Priest), Yasokawa depicts a statue of the Bodhisattva Jizō. A Bodhisattva is a being on the path to becoming a Buddha. Using a Buddhist deity Figure as a substitution for
                                    a human religious practitioner is an interesting ploy that most likely indexes the ubiquity and popularity of Jizō rather than his role as a Bodhisattva.</p>

                                    more idiosyncratic, such as Yamatohime-no-mikoto for the Hermit (<b>Figure 12</b>). In the <i>Kojiki</i> account Yamatohime-no-mikoto was commissioned by her father, the emperor Suinin (11th emperor according to the
                                    mythology), to locate a suitable place for the enshrinement of the Sun Goddess, Amaterasu. Starting out from the Yamato palace in Sakurai, Yamatohime-no-mikoto wandered the region for twenty years before arriving at
                                    Ise, where she established the inner shrine dedicated to the Sun Goddess. The Hermit card represents a search for truth and wisdom, often as a solitary quest. Yamatohime-no-mikoto was the <i>saiō</i> (the High Priestess
                                    of the Ise Shrine) who never married. The card shows her as elderly and robed in the white and red clothing of the miko (shrine attendant). Despite the gender shift, this Japanese Figure represents the ultimate solitary
                                    quest.

                                <p>There are some obvious or logical reasons for substituting figures on the European<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span>. Two figures in particular—an ancient queen and a medieval wizard— often replace the High
                                    Priestess card and the Magician card, respectively. One of the more common and fascinating substitutions is the historical Figure of Himiko (170–248 CE) as the emblem for the High Priestess. Himiko was the ruler of
                                    the earliest Japanese state, described by Chinese ethnographers in accounts that note her effectiveness as a political leader and a shaman specialist. She was reported to have unified 100 chiefdoms and to have been
                                    adept at divination and magic. Himiko is presented in popular culture in various ways, including solemnly regal, calculatingly evil, and frivolously erotic (Miller 2014b).<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span>                                    cards that feature her are some of the most beautiful, intriguing, and challenging. In his card for the High Priestess, the artist Yamamoto Naoki (2014, <b>Figure 13</b>) substitutes an image of a young Himiko in a
                                    provocative pose, with her bare legs exposed. Perhaps he hints at an inferred sexual power attributed to her because the idea of female power residing in religious and political acumen might not function well for a
                                    modern viewer.</p>

                                    hung upside down in web. Another well-known divination expert who uses the name Moon Princess Himiko has also produced<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span> decks (Kasai and Moon Princess Himiko 2002, see Appendix

                                <p>Another common replacement is to use a legendary <i>onmyōji</i> (wizard, literally “yin yang master”) to represent the Magician card. The wizard named Abeno Seimei (921–1005) became a colossal hit among female fans after
                                    he was the romanticized subject of novels, manga, anime and film from the 1990s (Miller 2008). Seimei was an occasional member of a guild of wizards officially part of the imperial court structure. In the

                                    shrines that are dedicated to him today. Here, this symbol has a separate history from its appearance in the West, and was b orrowed into<span class="key pl" about="Japan"> Japan </span>,from China, where it represented

                                <p>What do we learn about contemporary<span class="key pl" about="Japan"> Japan </span>,from surveying<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span> cards? Perhaps we cannot divine the future, but we can see a wealth of cultural
                                    adaptation and a playfulness with figures and symbols that preserves messages typically associated with<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span> but recasts them for an audience that is non-white, largely female,
                                    and highly attuned to<span class="key" about="visual"> visual </span>"messages. Clearly, the<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span> is a go-between—an intermediary between two different philosophies or worldviews.
                                    We do not always find a smooth reconciliation of different cultural elements on the cards, and the <span class="key" about="imagery">imagery</span> might occasionally leave us puzzled or uncomfortable. Nevertheless,
                                    the power of the card <span class="key" about="imagery">imagery</span> to traverse different time periods, cultural settings, and complex WesternJapanese <span class="key" about="imagery">imagery</span> is truly unique.

                                <p>The use of established themes already circulating in Japanese mass culture, such as Dayan or Hello Kitty, brings the Japanese viewer into a<span class="key" about="visual"> visual </span>"relationship with foreign philosophical
                                    concepts. For example, in order to represent the concept of addiction to money, sex, food, and power, the European deck often portrayed a pair of humans chained to a huge satyr. The Devil card in Japan, however, might
                                    r epresent this idea instead as a type of unhealthy or hedonistic temptation, such as addictive cravings for food. In the Hello Kitty Devil card, Kitty-chan dreams of fattening pudding and donuts. In the deck by Kasai
                                    and Moon Princess Himiko (2002), a young man is furtively eating a pomegranate. Such substitutions gloss over the gaps between Christian and Japanese worldviews, allowing the
                                    <span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span> entry into different metaphysical cultures. In order to avoid a foreign pictorial paradigm that indexes Christian concepts such as resurrection, sin, and salvation, Japanese
                                    artists have shown impressive creative and imaginative engagement that melds existing<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span> protocol with new elements and meanings. Using the currency of<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span>,

                                    their anxieties center on economic development and manifest themselves during discussions of branding and tourism campaigns. As the city prepared to host the Republican National Convention in 2012, local boosters fretted
                                    that <span class="key" about="Tampa"> Tampa </span> was too nondescript: “Florida’s metropolitan areas have well-established identities — Orlando for its theme parks and Miami for international flair. But, what is

                                    seemingly banal question resonated with greater significance, something that sparked my interest as a media scholar. I re-frame the question this way: In a world of diffuse and fragmented media, where old places and
                                    stories are displaced and obscured by layers of disconnected images and a growing, changing population, how do we understand who we are as a <span class="key" about="community"> community </span>? My response, at the

                                    learn about the city’s history and culture, but on another is an experiment in alternative knowledge legitimation grounded in electronic social networking technologies. Starting from the concept of <i>psychogeography</i>,
                                    a term defined by French cultural theorist Guy Debord (1955) as “the study of the precise laws and specific effects of the geographical environment, consciously organized or not, on the emotions and behaviors of individuals,”

                                    interfaces as familiar and intuitive to users as possible. The web-based card-reading interface randomly deals a spread from a deck of seventy-eight cards composed of twenty-two “trump” cards known as the Major Arcana
                                    and four suits of fourteen cards each. The trumps take us through a journey of innocence, initiation, temptation, sin, and redemption, just as they do in traditional <span class="key" about="Tarot"><span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span>                                    </span> decks. The figures and events they depict have been modified to reflect <span class="key" about="Tampa"> Tampa </span>’s people, history, and mythology, but their meanings are intended to coincide in spirit
                                    with other decks. The suits of Bolts, Doubloons, Estuary, and Swords in the <i><span class="key" about="Tampa"> Tampa </span><span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span></i> correspond to those of Wands, Coins/Pentacles,
                                    Cups, and Swords featured in Waite-Smith and other popular decks<sup><a href="#Footnote1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. Interactive readings are generated using the Celtic Cross spread, probably the most recognizable
                                    card-reading arrangement. The spread was popularized in the early twentieth century by Arthur Edward Waite, who described it as “the most suitable for obtaining an answer to a definite question.” Although many users
                                    no doubt will approach the reading as a tool for personal divination, instructions on the website encourage visitors to frame their questions around the entire <span class="key" about="Tampa"> Tampa </span> <span class="key"

                                <p>My work on this project began as a more playful exploration of how residents perceive their <span class="key" about="community"> community </span> identity in the age of networked electronic media, but its focus has shifted
                                    during the intervening years as the stakes for defining and sanctioning common knowledge have increased. With the rise of social media over the past decade, the effects of what Eli Pariser has described as “the filter
                                    bubble” (2011) have eroded our shared sense of <span class="key" about="community"> community </span> and, with it, a mutual understanding of the world around us that underpins our ability to make collective decisions.

                                <p>We witness this phenomenon globally in the rejection of scientific consensus on climate change by the president of the United States, no less. But we see it also in our communities. An example from my <span class="key"
                                        about="community"> community </span> arose in June 2017 when a large number of residents rejected a sand renourishment plan to protect beach communities on Florida’s Gulf Coast from storm surge even though these renourishment
                                    programs have been implemented without controversy for decades to the great benefit of our barrier islands (Douglas, 2017). While many interpret the increasing lack of consensus regarding the most basic states of affairs
                                    as a problem that must be corrected
                                    <i>within</i> the paradigm of literacy—such as increasing the use of fact checkers, for example—these perspectives underestimate the extent to which our culture exists in a world no longer governed by the conventions
                                    of print culture.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>Benedict Anderson (1983) has described the confluence of printing press, capitalism, and the nation state that emerged half a millennium ago to shape our modern world as “print capitalism.” In Imagined Communities, his
                                    seminal work on nationalism, he posits that, under print capitalism, thousands—even millions—of strangers could consider themselves “Brazilians” or “Germans” or “Japanese” or “Canadians” even to the point of sacrificing
                                    themselves, even though these entities really are contrivances, “imagined communities,” that forge common identities based around shared language and cultural practices. In a much-cited example, he writes of the silent
                                    newspaper reader who “is well aware that the ceremony he performs is being replicated by thousands (or millions) of others of whose existence he is confident, yet of whose identity he has not the slightest notion” (35).
                                    The power of that image to comprehend social cohesion is now belied by its belatedness. We have spent the past two decades in the twilight of print capitalism, and as we watch the more tangible elements of the apparatus
                                    give way we must consider what else will ebb with it.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>The decline of newspapers and its attendant toll on accountability journalism has been chronicled by scholars for more than a decade<sup><a href="#Footnote2">2</a></sup>. The effects are manifest not only in the thousands
                                    of professional journalists thrown out of work but also in the physical structures of our cities, which were shaped largely by twentieth-century communications technologies. New York’s Rockefeller Center, whose modern
                                    towers have housed some of the most powerful media organizations of the last century—RCA, NBC, and the Associated Press—is an obvious example of the powerful influence of broadcast-model media on our urban landscapes.
                                    Although Rockefeller Center still stands, the locus of media power has shifted far west of midtown Manhattan to the sprawling office parks of Silicon Valley. Locally, the effects on our cities are more tangible as landmark
                                    buildings that once held the trappings of centralized media authority within a <span class="key" about="community"> community </span>—the gatekeepers, philanthropists, and sports franchise owners—have been repurposed
                                    or erased altogether. In my city, the downtown headquarters for The <span class="key" about="Tampa"> Tampa </span> Tribune for more than forty years met the wrecking ball in early 2017. For several weeks during the
                                    spring, video of the demolition filled my social media feeds alongside the latest political outrages and the perpetual calls to end “fake news.” The choice riverfront lot will soon house luxury condominiums. I have

                                <p>Yet to leave the<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span> there, as a farewell postcard to print capitalism, does not even vaguely satisfy. To respond to “What is <span class="key" about="Tampa"> Tampa </span> Bay’s
                                    identity?” with “I have divined the future and it’s not that old newspaper plant anymore” will not suffice. Such as response does not get at that deeper, more urgent question of what the<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span>                                    can teach us about who we are as a <span class="key" about="community"> community </span>. To accomplish that, it is necessary to understand the cultural history of<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span> cards
                                    and how much of that history involved collective rather than individual practices of signification.</p>

                                <p>Contemporary industrialized culture understands the<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span> within the context of individual beliefs and concerns.<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span> card readings have been
                                    compared in popular culture and even in some scholarly work to Hermann Rorschach’s inkblot tests—in other words, as instances of individual psychological projection. For example, Paul Martin Lester’s <i>Visual Communication: Images with Messages</i>,
                                    groups
                                    <span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span> cards, the I-Ching, astrology, and ink blots as examples of “projection,” which he describes as a type of mental activity that affects<span class="key" about="visual"> visual </span>"perception
                                    (Lester, 2011: 63-64). A quiz on the website of the Science Channel’s Oddities San Francisco series (2012-13) noted that some psychologists “might see<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span> as a way of accessing
                                    a subject’s subconscious through that person’s free associations in reaction to images, much like a Rorschach test” (“Tarot Quiz”). Yet portrayals such as these miss the intrinsically social and historical character
                                    of the
                                    <span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span> and its narrative structure. With origins tracing back to at least the late Middle Ages in Europe, the<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span> draws on powerful cultural
                                    narratives that often frame the subject of a reading within the bounds of social approbation or condemnation. Those narratives were most prominently depicted in the Triumphs, which were allegorical pageants enacted
                                    in cities throughout Europe. Triumph narratives, such as Petrarch’s Il Trionfi in the fourteenth century, followed the tradition of The <i>Psychomachia</i>, the story of the soul’s journey through life and death written
                                    in Spain in the fifth century CE (Thomson, 1930: 109-112). The pageant processionals contained a series of carts depicting a portion of the story, with later carts triumphing over or “trumping” the carts preceding them
                                    (Huson, 2004: 30-31). The Triumphs were prevalent in Renaissance popular culture, and illustrated versions appeared “on Marriage chests, tapestries, relief carvings, and other decorative arts” (Place, 2010: 17). Robert
                                    Place, a well-known<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span> scholar and artist, notes that these illustrations, however intricate they may appear to us today, were cultural commonplaces whose lessons for the observer
                                    would have been obvious. He states that, “Instead of coming from the text, these illustrations seem to be informed by the popular symbolism of the day, possibly from the depiction of these characters in actual parades.
                                    All of these images were popular at the time of its creation and were as easily recognized as Santa Claus or Uncle Sam is now” (2010: 17).<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span> cards themselves appear to have
                                    been quite popular in Renaissance Europe, and, although surviving examples are mostly from hand-painted decks commissioned by wealthy patrons and treated as <i>objets d’art</i>, numerous inexpensive decks were produced
                                    from woodcuts and engravings (9). Thus, the meanings of<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span> cards were commonly understood, and the stories that emerged from card readings would have been situated within knowledge
                                    of everyday actions and values of the <span class="key" about="community"> community </span>.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>If we are, indeed, entering an era in which our understanding of facts is no longer rooted in a sense of sharing the day’s accounts with thousands of other newspaper readers or television viewers, then exploring the
                                    <span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span> may provide insight into what may comprise our new imagined communities. The <i><span class="key" about="Tampa"> Tampa </span><span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span></i>                                    project will allow me to test that hypothesis. Can a set of seventy-eight local cards sorted on a website and arrayed virtually around the city approximate a shared cultural experience or a point of common understanding?
                                    Can they do any more than amuse us, or perhaps teach us a little local history? Those answers have yet to be divined. In the meantime, I will conclude with one final image.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>On a street corner in Central <span class="key" about="Tampa"> Tampa </span> near where the construction of an interstate decimated a vibrant African-American <span class="key" about="community"> community </span> forty
                                    years ago, stands the Three of Swords. Known to many<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span> enthusiasts as the Sorrow card, it is depicted in the Waite-Smith deck as a heart pierced by three swords, and it portends
                                    deep sadness and painful truths. In the
                                    <i><span class="key" about="Tampa"> Tampa </span><span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span></i> version, the three swords plunge into a palmetto thicket outside of Fort Brooke, the U.S. military outpost established
                                    during the Seminole Indian Wars and around which the city grew. That old fort stands for many things, but in this case, it stands for insides and outsides, and for enforcing what goes where, in much the same way that
                                    the construction of highways does. In 1967, a <span class="key" about="Tampa"> Tampa </span> police officer shot a young black man named Martin Chambers in the back because he suspected him of robbing a pawn shop in
                                    the Central Avenue district. Days of riots followed. Scores of businesses along Central Avenue were burned and looted, and within a few years the interstate came through and finished off what was left. An investigation
                                    soon after Chambers’ death ruled that the police shooting was justified, a decision that bitterly divided the city and continues to resonate five decades later. Subsequent attempts to hold police accountable for the
                                    shooting, including an official request by the City of <span class="key" about="Tampa"> Tampa </span> as recent as 2008, have been unsuccessful (Guzzo, 2017; Hutcheson, 2007; Morrow, 2017). That is the story of my city’s
                                    sorrow. A few years ago, the city dedicated a portion of a park to commemorate Central Avenue. Near its entrance resides my own commemoration, the augmented reality Three of Sorrows, speaking its painful truth.</p>

                                    <p>Cormac McCarthy’s Blood Meridian tracks a young man known only as “the kid” through the lawless US-Mexico borderlands in the mid-1800s. The kid, either seeking adventure or seeking pure violence, joined a gang of scalp
                                        hunters known as the Glanton gang. Among this brutal coterie were John Glanton, Captain White, Toadvine, two men both named John Jackson, Tobin, the ex-priest, and Judge Holden. The judge, an enormous, hairless
                                        man, was a polyglot, a draftsman, a man of incredible knowledge among the uneducated villains. He reproduced everything he saw in a sketchbook before promptly destroying the very thing he drew—be it plant, stone,
                                        or animal. The judge practiced a sort of devout nihilism into which he tried to fold the resisting kid. The<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span> cards referred to in the novel allowed the reader to glean
                                        meaning from the story, just as the cards allow diviners to glean meaning from the real world. The cards that I will be exploring are the Fool, the Four of Cups, the Chariot, the High Priestess, the Four of Wands,
                                        the Hanged Man, the Devil, the Hermit, the Hierophant, Judgment, and Death. While the judge’s philosophy was laid out in his monologues, the taciturn kid’s beliefs must be read through the cards. In applying the
                                        symbols of the cards, I propose a reading of the novel in which the judge evangelized a dehumanizing dogma of nihilism while the kid holds out for a more positive philosophy that will give his life meaning.</p>
                                    <h3 class="title">THE ANATOMY OF THE DECK</h3>
                                    <p class="initialp">There are 78<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span> cards: 56 Minor Arcana, 22 Major. Diviners arranged the cards face-down called a spread; each placement represented a different aspect of the question. Perhaps
                                        one asked the mystic about one’s love life. The diviner, then, arranges the cards and flips them over in a predetermined order. The first might represent the person in question; the second, the person in question’s
                                        immediate future, distant future, distant past, and so on. Different cards yield different meanings, some of which I will go through individually. The Minor Arcana are in four suits: cups, pentacles, swords, and
                                        wands. Cups generally represent emotion and relationships; pentacles, material, possessions, swords, intellect and rationality; wands, energy and spirituality. Elementally, cups correspond with water, pentacles
                                        with earth, swords with air, and wands with fire. For each suit of the Minor Arcana, there is a page, a knight, a king, a queen, an ace, and numbers two through ten (e.g. the King of Cups, the nine of Swords). The
                                        Major Arcana are grand symbols such as the Tower of Destruction and the Moon. For divination purposes, each card has a different meaning, and when the card is inverted (drawn upside-down), this meaning changes—usually
                                        to something negative. In a<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span> reading, one might ask a single question, draw a card (or several), interpret it, and, if its meaning is obscure, the person in question
                                        might, then, draw another clarifying card.</p>
                                    <p>I will include pictures from the Waite-Smith<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span> deck. Although this deck was published after the novel’s setting, it has been very influential on modern interpretations of

                                    <br>
                                    <h4 class="tcard-title">The Fool</h4>
                                    <p>The Fool is looking not at the cliff falling off directly in front of him, but off into the sky. His dog nips at his heels, some say in warning (Nichols, 24). The Fool acts by intuition rather than rationality: “The
                                        Fool’s spontaneous approach to life combines wisdom, madness, and folly. When he mixes these ingredients in the right proportions, the results are miraculous, but when the mixture curdles, everything ends up in
                                        a sticky mess” (Nichols, 24). When reversed, the Fool is interpreted to mean that the drawer is either too cautious or too reckless (Greer, 41).</p>

                                    <br>
                                    <p>While on their trek through the desert in search of scalps, the Glanton gang was briefly joined by a family of circus performers. While camping together, the matriarch reads her<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span>                                        cards to tell the fortunes of the gang. Jackson, the first man to draw, picked this card which “bore the picture of a fool in harlequin and a cat” and was called “el tonto” (McCarthy, 97). Readers are not told what
                                        exactly the woman begins to chant, but the judge interprets her as saying: “in your fortune lie our fortunes all” (97).</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <h4 class="tcard-title">The Four of Cups</h4>
                                    <p>The Four of Cups suggests a “divided heart” and is “generally associated with mercy” (Sepich, 107). This comes from the Kabbalistic interpretation of the<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span> which connects
                                        fours of all suits with ‘chesed,’ which translates to ‘mercy’ (Sepich, 106).</p>

                                    <img src="IMG/APics/3-Figure2.jpg" alt="Tarot in Blood Meridian - Figure2">
                                    <p align="center"><b>Figure 2:</b> The Four of Cups Card</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>In the Waite-Smith illustration, viewers are shown a man sitting meditatively under a tree ignoring the gift of an additional cup. One interpretation is the man was being tempted by this offering. Often, he is interpreted
                                        as ignoring the gifts of the world and taking them for granted (Greer, 124). This card is also associated with daydreaming on things that are not there yet ignoring that which is (Greer, 124). Inverted, this card
                                        represents a “lack of devotion” (Bradford, 21). It also represents boredom, restlessness, and a need to move on (Greer, 125).</p>
                                    <p>The Four of Cups is the only card in the novel that appeared twice. The first time was when the kid and Sproule encountered an empty, burned village, PHILOLOGIA just before they discovered the heap of corpses in the
                                        local church. In one house, they found: “Illustrations cut from an old journal and pasted to the wall, a small picture of a queen, a gypsy card that was the four of cups” (McCarthy, 63). At the reading, the kid
                                        drew the Four of Cups: “He’d not seen such cards before, yet the one he held seemed familiar to him. He turned it upside down and regarded it and he turned it back” (McCarthy, 97). The Four of Cups is also the first
                                        explicitly inverted card in the novel.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <h4 class="tcard-title">The Chariot</h4>
                                    <p>The Chariot was the novel’s second inverted card. The Chariot referred not to the driver, but to the vehicle that bore him. The prevailing interpretation is fate or the power of the human will. It is also associated
                                        with hubris (Nichols, 145). Inverted, the Chariot illustrated recklessness, the lack of self-control, surges of power, and disregard for the effects of your pursuits on others (Greer, 58).</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <img src="IMG/APics/3-Figure3.jpg" alt="Tarot in Blood Meridian - Figure3">
                                    <p align="center"><b>Figure 3:</b> The Chariot Card</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>After Glanton, the leader of the gang, draws the Chariot, the beldam began chanting. The chanting angered Glanton so much that he drew out his gun. Glanton’s anger was illustrative of the rashness represented in the
                                        card. “La carroza, la carroza, cried the beldam. Invertido. Carta de Guerra, de venganza. La vi sin ruedas sobre un rio obscuro…” (McCarthy, 100). This quote was a clear representation of the Chariot inverted: it
                                        has no wheels, no way of controlling it. “Wheel” may also refer to another card, the Wheel of Fortune, which does not represent luck so much as it does with fate (Greer, 64). Not even fate guides the wild journey
                                        of the Glanton gang.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <h4 class="tcard-title">The Devil</h4>
                                    <p>The judge was a devil-like character—a brilliant dancer, fiddler, a powerful being and tempter. The Devil, of course, was a figure that was not specific to<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span>. Later in the
                                        paper, I will discuss the judge and the Devil in more detail, but here I will merely outline what the Devil represents in the cards. The Devil represented lies, fear, cruel use of power, domination, and addiction
                                        (Greer, 77). The “shadow” aspects are on display in the Devil—these are parts of oneself that one does not wish to associate with or even confront (Greer, 78).</p>

                                    <h4 class="tcard-title">The Hermit</h4>
                                    <p>The kid met a hermit early on in the novel. The man was kind enough, opening up his home to the kid, but, ultimately, he was revealed as a deviant: he proudly owned a black, shriveled human heart and the kid woke up
                                        in the middle of the night to the disheveled man bowed over him.</p>
                                    <br>

                                    <br>
                                    <p>The Hermit lived by his lamp, the golden thing that he had discovered. He was a solitary figure, unlike the Hierophant, and so subverts establishment spirituality:
                                        <q>His lamp seems an apt symbol for the individual insight of the mystic. Whereas the Pope’s chief emphasis lies in religious experience under conditions prescribed by the Church, the Hermit offers us the possibility of individual illumination as a universal human potential, an experience not confined to canonized saints. (Nichols, 166)</q>
                                        <p>The Hermit could represent the spiritual pining that many people go through in life—looking for wisdom greater than themselves in others (Nichols, 168).</p>
                                        <br>
                                        <h4 class="tcard-title">Judgment</h4>
                                        <p>This is a card with religious <span class="key" about="imagery">imagery</span>. An angel blew his trumpet and the dead risen from their graves, an illustration of the Bible’s account of Judgment day: 1 Thessalonians
                                            4:16: “For the Lord himself, with a cry of command, with the archangel’s call and with the sound of God’s trumpet, will descend from heaven, and the dead in Christ will rise first.” Compare also to Revelation
                                            20:13: “Death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them, and all were judged according to what they had done.”</p>

                                            onto others, you may see them as trying to influence people through the force of their personality or propaganda” (Greer, 92). The judge certainly has a powerful personality, and he aimed to influence what he
                                            judges (perhaps those things he writes in his book), through destruction or otherwise.</p>

                                            away and readers were not surprised, although his thoughts were rarely made known. The judge and Tobin had long monologues in which the kid responded with little more than “I know” and “Yeah.” However, his drawing
                                            of the Four of Cups and the way that it “seemed familiar to him” (McCarthy, 99) gave readers some insight (which I will shortly explain by analyzing the meaning of the card) into his heart beyond which readers
                                            were explicitly told about him.</p>
                                        <p>The Four of Cups could be associated with mercy, a divided heart (Sepich, 107), or even a “lack of devotion” (Greer, 21). The kid, after he ran away, looked for a surrogate family, something to fill the lack of
                                            nurture he received from his own family. He found a Hermit, Captain White, and Glanton and his gang, all while avoiding the judge. His desire to find something greater than himself to cling to divided his heart
                                            between the pursuit of belonging and the judge’s spiritual nihilism.</p>
                                        <p>At the outset of the novel, the kid encountered the hermit: “Solitary, half mad, his eyes redrimmed as if locked in their cages with hot wires. But a ponderable body for that” (McCarthy, 17). The hermit gave the
                                            kid a place to sleep for the night, water to drink and a fire to sit by. Despite his “ponderable body”—the acuity that readers are led to believe the hermit might possess—readers were soon shown that solitude
                                            does not produce a person that one aspires to be nor one with something valuable to teach others. When the kid asked where he could get some water, the hermit told him to follow the path outside. The kid protested
                                            that it is too dark, but the hermit rebutted: “It’s a deep path. Foller ye feet. Foller ye mule. I caint go” (McCarthy, 17). The kid, embodying elements of the Fool on his journey, was encouraged to follow his
                                            intuition and his animal instinct, but the Hermit was no such character. He clung to the shelter that he had managed to establish. The Hermit shrugged off the wise-old-man archetype and admitted to certain limitations
                                            despite having the wisdom of survival. The novel’s hermit kept a blackened human heart with him in his home, which showed readers just how removed from the rest of the world one can become when one chooses a
                                            cloistered life—the closest he came to human understanding was the feeling of a dried heart in his palm. In the night that he spent in the hermit’s cave, the kid “woke sometime in the night with the hut in almost
                                            total darkness and the hermit bent over him and all but in his bed” (McCarthy, 21). Hermits and monks have a sort of wisdom attached to them—many people seek them out for spiritual guidance. This hermit is no
                                            such source.</p>
                                        <p>Captain White is the kid’s next false leader. White has had previous followers with almost cult-like zeal, such as the man who recruited the kid, telling him: “If I’d not run up on Captain White I don’t know where
                                            I’d be this day. I was a sorrier sight even than what you are and he come along and raised me up like Lazarus. Set my feet on the path of righteousness” (McCarthy, 32). The man was comparing Captain White to
                                            a sort of powerful religious figure―exactly the sort that gained an undeserved following. It does not take long for the kid to realize that he has walked with yet another false prophet. After a battle between
                                            the Native American army and Captain White’s battalion, the kid sees Captain White’s head in a jar. The kid remarked, “Somebody ought to have pickled [White’s head] a long time ago. By rights they ought to pickle
                                            mine. For ever takin up with such a fool” (McCarthy, 74). In hindsight, the kid recognized the hollowness of White’s command. He specifically used the word “fool,” which occurs frequently within the novel and
                                            was interpreted as many instantiations of the Fool card in<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span>. This particular use likely referred to the Fool’s recklessness and his ignorance of the path ahead, emphasized
                                            by Captain White’s willingness to lead others to their deaths.</p>
                                        <p>The taciturn kid does not seem particularly moved by John Glanton. It was the kid’s ally Toadvine who put them in Glanton’s service. It was not out of reverence for the man, but out of a desire to avoid prison.
                                            There were no tender moments between Glanton and the kid. However, in a conversation with the judge, the kid defended his former leader. In their last conversation as members of the Glanton gang, the judge asks
                                            the kid: “Do you think Glanton was a fool? Dont you know he’d have killed you?” (McCarthy 319). Here the Fool reappeared, again compared to perceived leaders. The judge’s question seemed to imply that Glanton
                                            was not a fool. Perhaps the judge’s question was meant to show the kid that Glanton was ignorant to the danger of their trade and the recklessness with which their inverted chariot rode. The kid defended the
                                            man saying: “He never took part in your craziness” (McCarthy, 320). It seems that the kid wanted to remember his leader well, but the judge rightly revealed Glanton to be another false one. Within the Glanton
                                            gang, the kid also looked to Tobin the ex-priest for guidance. When the judge turned on the kid and Tobin, they joined forces to escape from the judge. At one point, Tobin told the kid to go on without him,
                                            but the kid refused to abandon the ex-priest. Tobin apparently had no qualms about abandoning the kid, which the latter learned when he woke up in a jail cell alone. The judge, sitting on the other side of the
                                            bars, asked him this: “What joins men together, he said, is not the sharing of bread but the sharing of enemies. But if I was your enemy with whom would you have shared me? With whom? The priest? Where is he
                                            now?” (McCarthy, 319). Damningly, the judge pointed out Tobin’s desertion, but not before making reference to the fact that the kid desired someone to align with. The judge suggested that the kid would not make
                                            enemies without allies and that even alliances come from animosities.</p>
                                        <p>In the aftermath of the Glanton gang dispersal, the kid wandered alone for 29 years. It was in this time that readers saw his last attempt to find someone to connect with—an elderly hispanic woman who was, like
                                            the kid, completely alone. It was a surprisingly sentimental scene for one so reserved: <q>He made his way among the corpses and stood before her. [The lone woman] was very old and her face was gray and leathery and sand had collected in the folds of her clothing. She did not look up. The shawl that covered her head was much faded of its color yet it bore like a patent woven into the fabric the figures of stars and quartermoons and other insignia of a provenance unknown to him. He spoke to her in a low voice he told her that he was an American and that he was a long way from the country of his birth and that he had no family and that he had traveled much and seen many things and had been at war and endured hardships. He told her that he would convey her to a safe place, some party of her country people who would welcome her and that she should join them for he could not leave her in this place or she would surely die. (McCarthy 328)</q></p>
                                        <p>Not only did the kid, in a seemingly uncharacteristic act of charity, tried to help the old woman, he told her that he would take her to be with her people. He admitted to her that he was not even close to his country
                                            in which he had no family. The moment he found another lone person, he immediately bonded with them, looking desperately for a human connection in this world. Most tellingly, reader were told his exact words
                                            to her: “Abuelita, he said. No puedes escucharme?” (McCarthy, 328). The kid has added a diminutive to the Spanish word for grandmother: “Abuela.” He was using the informal “tu” with her. This type of language
                                            would only be appropriate if one were talking to one’s own grandmother. Calling her “Grandmother,” might have evoked the drama of encountering Mother Earth, but instead, it more closely resembles calling one’s
                                            middle-school teacher “Mom” by accident or referring to a stranger as “Gramm-Gramm.” This scene demonstrates the kid’s desperation to find someone in this world to connect to. Yet, human connection has once
                                            again been pulled from under him when the woman turned out to be a corpse: “She was just a dried shell and she had been dead in that place for years” (McCarthy, 328).

                                        <h3 class="title">THE JUDGE’S SPIRITUAL NIHILISM<br>AND<br>THE KID AS HERETIC</h3>
                                        <br>
                                        <p class="initialp">If the kid was so lonely, why doesn’t he turn to the judge? The judge seemed to have some fixation on him. The judge tempted the kid with payment for his pistol like the Devil in the desert; he visited him in jail;
                                            and he finally enfolded him in some awful embrace. The judge also seemed to understand the kid’s yearning, telling him: “Don’t look away. We are not speaking in mysteries. You of all men are no stranger to that
                                            feeling, the emptiness and the despair. It is that which we take arms against, is it not?” (McCarthy, 343). While the judge was taking arms, the kid was looking for someone to follow. It was in part this apparent
                                            lack of mystery that the kid rebelled against. The judge espoused this sort of positive nihilism—rather than there not being anything, there is nothing. In the same way that one might criticize the watchmaker
                                            argument and other theories of intelligent design for showing a lack of faith in the power of randomness and void, so did the judge insists that believing in nothing was different than not believing in anything.
                                            Unprovoked, he told the Glanton gang at fire one evening: “Your heart’s desire is to be told some mystery. The mystery is that there is no mystery” (McCarthy, 263). The shocking revelation of the judge’s world
                                            was not that there was some great unseen power, but that insufficient power has been attributed to what was seen. Another spiritual statement by the judge came from his speech on the nobility of war: “War is
                                            the ultimate game because war is at last a forcing of the unity of existence. War is god” (McCarthy, 261). The judge, like the kid, saw divinity in the “unity of existence.” The kid searched for a place to belong
                                            while the judge surveyed land to conquer—both set out with the intention of discovering some sort of harmony. The judge’s evidence was the word of god, delivered through: “stones and trees, the bones of things”
                                            (McCarthy, 123). Perhaps these bones include the skull of the novel’s epigraph—the scalped head of a hominid. The judge seemed aware of this or other evidence for ancient violence, as he ominously put it: “War
                                            was always here. Before man was, war waited for him. The ultimate trade awaiting its ultimate practitioner” (McCarthy, 259). “War gods” had been replaced in the west by “personal saviors,” so this notion might
                                            be unattractive to readers: all one has was what one can observe and one’s inescapable observation was that one was part of an enduringly violent species. The kid, readers know, was inclined towards mindless
                                            violence; yet he repeatedly rejected the judge and the judge found himself wanting.</p>
                                        <p>The judge accused the kid of not being fully committed to the Glanton gang, an accusation wellillustrated by analyzing the judge as<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span>’s Judgment and the kid as the Four
                                            of Cups. The judge told the kid that there was a “flawed place in the fabric of [his] heart” (McCarthy, 312), which was reminiscent of the “divided heart” sentiment of the Four of Cups. The judge went on to
                                            call the kid “mutinous” and claimed that: “You alone reserved in your soul some corner of clemency for the heathen” (McCarthy, 312). “Clemency” is “mercy [or] leniency” especially as it is “shown in the exercise
                                            of authority or power” (OED). The kid had some amount of power, which might amount to no more than his free will: his ability to choose not to shoot the judge, to help a man dig an arrow out of his leg, and
                                            even to hold back a part of himself and not fully participate in the exploits of the Glanton gang. The kid’s actions were in keeping with the judge’s own vision of himself as suzerain. The kid was able to maintain
                                            some amount of autonomy under the judge, who, acting as suzerain: “rules even when there are other rulers. His authority countermands local judgments” (McCarthy 207). However, by showing “clemency for the heathen,”
                                            the kid’s belief in mercy went against the religious order established in the judge’s kingdom. As in many civilizations, this subversion of religious principles resulted in the persecution of the kept by the
                                            keeper. It might seem as though “heathen” refers to the Native Americans, as they were frequently referred to as such. However, it is clear that two major tenets of the judge’s religious understanding were:
                                            there was no great mystery, and war was god. The kid himself was the heathen, and he has clemency for the part of his divided heart that continued to yearn for that mystery greater than himself and a sense of
                                            belonging. When the judge visited the kid in prison, he said to the kid: “it was required of no man to give more than he possessed nor was any man’s share compared to another’s only each was called upon to empty
                                            out his heart into the common and one did not” (McCarthy, 319). The kid did not give everything over to the Glanton gang because he was looking for a group to belong to, not the judge’s devotion to war as an
                                            observable fact of life.</p>

                                        <br>
                                        <p class="initialp">The<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span>’s Judgment depicted a scene from Revelation in which the dead were resurrected by the blowing of the archangel’s trumpet. This card was often seen to represent triumph
                                            over death and higher consciousness (Place, 211), the former of which might explain why the narrator told readers thrice at the close of the novel that the judge “says that he will never die” (McCarthy, 348).
                                            Judgment and Judgment Day were repeatedly referred to in the Book of Revelation. The judge’s book in which he attempted to record things before destroying them reminded one of the book of life by which humanity
                                            will be judged: <q>And the sea gave up the dead that were in it, Death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them, and all were judged according to what they had done. Then Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This was the second death, the lake of fire; and anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire. Revelation 20:13-15</q></p>
                                        <p>The Judgment card of the<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span> depicted this moment of resurrection and triumph over death, but readers knew that soon after, judgment would be cast, and those whom the judge
                                            has not approved for autonomy would be killed. The judge’s favorite game was also present in the New Testament’s final book: “war broke out in heaven; Michael and his angels fought against the dragon” (Revelation
                                            7:7). The dragon (the Devil) lost this war and was sent to earth. After a stint on earth, he himself was sent to the lake of fire with “the false prophet” (Revelation 20:10), reemphasizing the presence of fraudulent
                                            and hollowed sources of meaning and malevolent deceivers. The judgment that the judge put onto the kid was also present in this apocalyptic book. In one of the letters of Revelation that the narrator was given
                                            to send to the 12 churches, it was written: “because you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I am about to spit you out of my mouth” (Revelation 3:16). In this same way, the judge deemed the kid “lukewarm”
                                            —the kid is “not partisan” (McCarthy, 312). The judge attempted to evangelize to the kid of the divinity of war, but the kid clung to something more beautiful and finished the novel “against [the judge’s] immense
                                            and terrible flesh” (McCarthy, 347). The judge judged other people as well. When recording things in his book, the judge did not worry if people refused to be put into it, saying: “Whether in my book or not,
                                            every man is tabernacle in every other and he in exchange and so on in an endless complexity of being and witness to the uttermost edge of the world” (McCarthy, 147). The judge knew enough about humanity to
                                            account for everyone, to judge everyone, and he thinks little of most people. His low opinion on humanity mirrored the way in which perpetrators of heinous violence often dehumanize the groups against which
                                            they acted. In order to frame this with<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span>, I will compare this to Judge Holden’s role as the Fool.</p>

                                        <p class="initialp">The Fool was often pictured with a dog or some other small pet at his heels; in Blood Meridian, the Fool in the card was accompanied by a cat. Some scholars compared the Fool’s relationship with his dog to a king’s
                                            relationship with his fool (Nichols, 24). The Fool has a wide range of characteristics—he could be seen as very wise in his lack of prejudice, or stupid and reckless in his blind pursuits. Thus, it was not difficult
                                            to imagine that the interchangeability of the roles of king, fool, and dog. In her article arguing that the judge best embodies the Fool, Stinson argued that the judge’s dual role as the fool and the king fulfilled
                                            his role as suzerain—ruler among and above other rulers (Stinson, 14). The judge ruled over the Glanton gang even while Glanton was the captain. For example, Glanton has great talent taming animals, but although
                                            he could make a mean dog follow him and he responded to the title of “jefe,” readers knew that the judge ultimately had the upper hand on Glanton due to their “secret commerce” and their “terrible covenant”
                                            (McCarthy, 132).</p>
                                        <p>Instead of owning a dog, the judge owned a person. When the gang met a man who travelled with his mentally challenged twin brother, James Robert, the judge adopted James Robert and, as Stinson argued, James Robert
                                            assumed the role of the Fool’s dog (Stinson, 14). James Robert was mostly referred to as the imbecile and the idiot in readers’ earliest interactions with him, but was called a fool more often as the novel progresses.
                                            Keeping a man as a pet is a dehumanizing act. Towards the end of the novel, the gang takes shelter near a <span class="key" about="community"> community </span> of women who recognize this dehumanization and
                                            try to rectify it. They bathed James Robert, put him in a collared shirt and a wool suit, greased his hair, fed him candy, and kissed him goodnight. After this attempt to re-humanize him, James Robert returned
                                            to the water and almost drowns: [the judge] stepped into the river and seized up the drowning idiot, snatching it aloft by the heels like a great midwife and slapping it on the back to let the water out. […]
                                            he twisted the water from its hair and he gathered the naked and sobbing fool into his arms and carried it up into the camp and restored it among its fellows. (McCarthy, 270)</p>
                                        <p>Though this might seem a sweet moment, the judge saved James Robert only to make him his personal pet. Someone gave James Robert alcohol and watched him dance by the fire. When the Native Americans raided the camp,
                                            they found the judge in bed with a young girl and James Robert present. James Robert followed the judge until he disappeared from the novel. The judge had no problem with treating others as though they were
                                            less than human; however, it was not merely his treatment of James Robert, but his outlook on humanity as a whole that was degrading.</p>
                                        <p>During the final conversation between the kid and the judge, the latter picked apart a man across the bar. The judge criticized his lack of agency: “his life is so balked about by difficulty and become so altered
                                            of its intended architecture that he is little more than a walking hovel hardly fit to house the human spirit at all” (McCarthy, 343). The judge seemed to think this man’s existence was typical of humans, telling
                                            the kid to “Pick a man, any man” (McCarthy, 343), reaffirming his belief that every man is housed in every other. The inability of men to bend things outside themselves to their wills and realize their own destinies
                                            leads him, the judge, to devalue them. This sort of separation of oneself from inferior others had often been used to justify war and other acts of violence. Genocide Watch published a series of eight stages
                                            of genocide in 1988. The first three are classification―establishing an “us and them,” symbolization―naming these separate groups, and dehumanization― denying the humanity of the other group. The judge was not
                                            targeting a group and calling them less than human, but rather placing himself as suzerain and judge over a species he deemed more or less insignificant on the whole. The fear of dehumanization is that: “perceiving
                                            particular groups or individuals as subhuman can form the basis for justifying social and oral exclusion” (Vasiljevic and Viki, 137). This process leaves the dehumanized population vulnerable to violence on
                                            the immeasurable scales of the genocides society had witnessed in society as well as in the world of Blood Meridian. Science, for many years, was concerned with defending this process of dehumanization. An “anthropologist”
                                            named William Edwards: “postulated a basic distinction of people who are tall with long heads versus those who are shorter and have round heads, which foreshadowed the dichotomy of ‘Nordics’ compared with lesser
                                            breeds. He also contended that the physical differences would correspond to mental ones” (Jahoda, 14). This was a project of phrenology, a debunked pseudoscience that sought to uncover human nature by measuring
                                            the shapes of skulls. The judge pursued a similar study with the cranium of James Robert’s brother: “The judge reached out and took hold of the man’s head in his hands and began to explore its contours” (McCarthy,
                                            249). The judge was very curious about the fact that James Robert’s brother was not similarly afflicted. As a man of both science and violence, the judge sought figure the world in such a way that he was above
                                            those whom he judged, much in the same way that similar, historical scalp-hunters would have imagined the victims of the genocide to which they contributed.</p>

                                        <h3 class="title">CONCLUSION</h3>
                                        <br>
                                        <p class="initialp">Blood Meridian was rife with<span class="key" about="Tarot"> Tarot </span> cards and similar archetypes. Analyzing these cards has led me down several paths. I explored the divided heart of the kid—the way in which
                                            the divided heart that the judge accuses him of having is illumined by his connection to the Four of Cups. This analysis required delving into the judge’s religious beliefs, if they can be called so, and the
                                            kid’s conviction that there was more to be felt. I, then, compared the judge to the Judgment card and reemphasized this conflict between mercy and judgment played out by this paper’s focal characters. Finally,
                                            the judge resembled a perverted version of the Fool, one mixed with the Devil. The judge confidently strode along the edge of the cliff with his dehumanized pet James Robert in tow. The judge considered himself
                                            a man of science, a man with an airtight philosophy, and does not question himself as he dehumanized all mankind in order to justify obscene acts of violence. Just as McCarthy opened the novel with a quote recounting
                                            the discovery of evidence for a genocide thousands of years old, I will close this paper with a quote from Alan McGlashan, a pilot in the first World War and a psychiatrist in the second. It similarly illustrated
                                            the real world philosophy of war as a nihilistic philosophy written into human nature: War is the punishment of man’s disbelief in those forces within himself. It is the cruel reaffirmation of those powers which
                                            the ego can never command or subdue. And disastrous as the cost may be, something in the depths of man is mysteriously assuaged by this release of daemonic and destructive energies. There is a fierce satisfaction
                                            in living under the rule of the Early Gods. There is dignity in facing powers beyond us, and indifferent to us. To be blind to this, to fail to grasp its difficult meaning, is to let slip the golden Ariadne’s
                                            thread that may lead man at last out of the stinking labyrinth of War. (36-7)</p>
                                        <p>Not only does this beautifully capture McCarthy’s style—with ancient indifferent gods and the veneration of war, but it also described the nature of the kid’s divided heart. The kid rejected the judge―why? He fought
                                            against his own nature and his inclination for violence in defense of the human spirit. The kid “fails to grasp its difficult meaning,” and only fought harder against his own shadow as it manifested in the judge.
                                            Readers, like the kid, cognitively or even spiritually knew that humans have no need to partake in war and violence, but to dismiss them from human nature was to underestimate our capabilities to apply science
                                            and religion to justify cruelty of which all humans are capable. The judge used twisted logic to marry barbarity and moral reasoning; the kid struggled to oppose the judge’s nihilism with a belief system that
                                            allowed for humans to be violent while still being deemed good by some undefined objective moral truth.</p>
